To set up for Monopoly, run the file Monopoly.sql (located at Monopoly/Monopoly.sql) in MySQL Workbench. Then open the file JDBCDriver.java (Monopoly/src/resources/JDBCDriver.java) and edit line 46 to include the correct username and password for connecting to the MySQL Workbench.

To start Monopoly, first run Server.java (Monopoly/src/server/Server.java) and enter a port number. Then run Client.java (Monopoly/src/client/Client.java) and enter the server IP address and port number to connect. Upon connecting to the server, the login window should launch.
